### In order to build a project, you need to get and create a key for the API

> To get api_key you could write `/api` to telegram bot [@mgke_slave_bot](https://t.me/mgke_slave_bot)

1. Create a folder named assets in the YOUR_PROJECT\app\src\main\assets directory of your project. If the assets folder already exists, skip this step.
2. Inside the assets folder, create a file named config.properties.
3. Open the config.properties file and add your keys and configuration parameters:

```properties
api_key=your_key
```

**Important:** Make sure that the config.properties file is not added to version control (e.g., Git) or otherwise publicly accessible to avoid leaking confidential data.
